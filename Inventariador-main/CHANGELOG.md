## [2.6.0] — 2026-07-24

### Summary

Major stability release focusing on mobile boot reliability, authentication overhaul with MASTER DRIVE bypass, CI/CD pipeline with automated APK builds, and Dexie.js offline-first persistence.

### Highlights

#### 🚀 MASTER DRIVE — Super Admin Bypass

Users can now authenticate offline with the sovereign credential `Glaucio@1970` / `admin`, bypassing all local validation, SQLite, and Supabase checks. The bypass injects `gbr_admin_scope: GLOBAL_SUPER_ADMIN` and routes directly to the database manager screen.

- Fast credential check at the top of `handleSubmit` — early return guaranteed
- Session cleanup via `sessionStorage.clear()` before injecting admin scope
- `tenantId` set to `GBR_SUPER_ADMIN_CORINGA` for ecosystem-wide access
- Email `semorr@gmail.com` included in the master user profile for post-login routing

#### 🛡️ Boot Stability — No More Black Screen

Three-layer defense against black screen on mobile:

1. **Module-level `InitializeBootPipeline` removed** — previously removed the loader before React mounted. Now runs inside `useEffect` after React is safely mounted
2. **Global try/catch in `index.tsx`** — wraps `createRoot().render()` with a DOM fallback that shows the error and a "REINICIAR APP" button
3. **Init timeout reduced from 35s to 6s** — forces `setIsInitializing(false)` after 6 seconds, guaranteeing the login screen appears even if SQLite hangs

#### 🔐 Offline-First Authentication

Three-tier authentication pipeline:

1. **MASTER DRIVE** (sovereign bypass — `Glaucio@1970` / `admin`)
2. **Dexie.js / localforage lookup** (`localDb.users.get({ email })`) — searches persisted user profiles for offline login
3. **Supabase Cloud Auth** — falls through to cloud with network error detection; successfully authenticated cloud users are persisted locally for future offline access

#### 📱 PWA & CI/CD Improvements

- Android APK workflow with Gradle 8.11.1 and JDK 21
- Explicit Cache scoping to `Inventariador-main/` subdirectory
- PWA precache reconfigured: removed `.wasm` from glob to fix conflicting cache entries
- Service Worker now generates 23 precache entries (down from 24)
- Logo placeholder created in `/public/logo.png` to resolve manifest icon 404

### Features

- `feat(auth)`: MASTER DRIVE — sovereign credential bypass with GLOBAL_SUPER_ADMIN scope ([7d2975c])
- `feat(storage)`: `navigator.storage.persist()` — prevents OS from clearing IndexedDB ([c23b468])
- `feat(persistence)`: Dexie offline-first fallback across Dashboard, Consultation, AssetMap, AssetDetail ([fb1a4d1])
- `feat(ux)`: Loading skeleton states while Dexie queries run ([8d31465])
- `feat(ci)`: Android APK build workflow with dynamic versioning and caching ([8a0a5cc])

### Bug Fixes

- `fix(boot)`: Removed module-level `InitializeBootPipeline()` that removed loader before React mount ([f18a669])
- `fix(boot)`: Added global try/catch in `index.tsx` with DOM error fallback ([f18a669])
- `fix(boot)`: Reduced initialization timeout from 35s to 6s to guarantee login screen ([e7a2dee])
- `fix(boot)`: Fixed black screen after MASTER DRIVE — `LOAD_DATABASE` not in enum, replaced with `DATABASE_MANAGER` ([b54f954])
- `fix(boot)`: Added `.catch(() => 0)` to `countAtivos()` for fresh-install SQLite edge case ([4585782])
- `fix(auth)`: MASTER DRIVE credential changed from `semorr@gmail.com` to `Glaucio@1970` ([ee36aa2])
- `fix(auth)`: Added `email` field to masterUser for post-login routing ([f93d658])
- `fix(auth)`: Added validation console.log at start of `handleSubmit` for mobile diagnostics ([2baff0f])
- `fix(nav)`: Added `/auditor/selecionar-filial` to path mapping ([92a6dc9])
- `fix(ui)`: Replaced hardcoded `VERSÃO 2.6` with dynamic `pkg.version` ([c480ba1])
- `fix(ci)`: Upgraded JDK 17→21 and Gradle 8.11.1 for `bcprov-jdk18on` compatibility ([3d4662d])
- `fix(ci)`: Scoped Cache and Upload paths to `Inventariador-main/` subdirectory ([a92aadf])
- `fix(build)`: Fixed Motion imports for ESM compatibility ([d4517fe])
- `fix(pwa)`: Removed `.wasm` from glob patterns to fix conflicting cache entries ([2baff0f])

### Chores

- `chore(ci)`: Force-trigger build workflow ([8428dfb])
- `chore(ci)`: Remove stale nested workflow to avoid duplicates ([c6e0198])

### Dependencies Updated

| Package | From → To | Reason |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `motion` | 10.16.4 → 11.11.17 | ESM import compatibility |
| `vite-plugin-pwa` | 0.17.4 → 0.19.0 | PWA generation fixes |
| `@capacitor-community/sqlite` | 5.x → 6.x | Native SQLite stability |
| `vite` | 5.0.11 → 5.1.4 | Build toolchain |

### Known Issues

- `logo.png` is a placeholder 1x1 red pixel — needs a proper 192x192 logo for PWA icons
- `sessionStorage.clear()` in MASTER DRIVE is aggressive — may remove boot flags set by other modules
- App may load slowly on first install due to IndexedDB initialization

### Upgrade Guide

1. Update to the latest APK from GitHub Actions
2. Login with the new sovereign credential: `Glaucio@1970` / `admin`
3. If experiencing black screen, wait up to 6 seconds for the forced login render
4. Clear browser/WebView cache if Service Worker conflict errors appear
